%TRUNC Truncate the exponents and coefficients of a fractional-order transfer function.

%      Usage: G1 = trunc(G, na_acc, a_acc)
%      where       G - initial system
%                  na_acc - exponent accuracy (i.e. 1e-2 means 2 decimal
%                  places)
%                  a_acc - coefficient accuracy
