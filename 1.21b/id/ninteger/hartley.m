function G = hartley (w, gain, phase, Q, n, type)

% G = hartley (w, gain, phase, n, ordmax, type)
% This function returns a model for a plant
% with a known frequency behaviour.
% The model is either
% G(1)*s^(n*Q) + G(2)*s^((n-1)Q) + ... + G(end-2)*s^(2*Q) + G(end-1)*s^Q + G(end)
% or else the inverse of the above.
% The function receives the gain in dB and the phase in degrees
% for frequencies, in rad/s, specified in w.
% Parameter Q must be supplid;
% if n (the desired number of zeros and poles of the model)
% is not supplied, length(w)-1 is assumed instead;
% type may be 'num' or 'den' for the two types of models stated above:
% it may be ommited, the default being 'den'.
